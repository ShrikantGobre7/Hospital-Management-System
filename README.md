# Hospital-Management-System
A Hospital Management System (HMS) in C++ with file handling is a comprehensive software application designed to streamline and optimize the management of a hospital's various operations, including patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing, and more. This system will use file handling to store and retrieve data, ensuring that information is stored securely and efficiently. Below is a detailed project description for building a Hospital Management System in C++ with file handling:

Project Title: Hospital Management System in C++ with File Handling

Project Overview:
The Hospital Management System is a software solution that aims to simplify the administrative and operational tasks in a hospital or medical facility. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for both hospital staff and patients, enabling them to access and manage various aspects of the hospital efficiently. The project will be implemented in C++ and use file handling for data storage and retrieval.

Features:

1.Patient Registration:
Capture and store patient information, including name, address, contact details, and medical history.
Assign a unique patient ID for each registration.

2.Medical Records Management:
Maintain electronic health records (EHR) for each patient.
Record and update medical history, diagnoses, prescribed medications, and treatment plans.
Ensure data security and access control for sensitive medical information.

3.Billing and Payment:
Generate and manage invoices for services rendered to patients.
Maintain billing history and payment records.
Provide itemized billing for transparency.

4.Doctor and Staff Management:
Maintain a database of doctors and staff members.
Track their schedules, roles, and contact details.
Pharmacy and Inventory Management:

5.Search and Reporting:
Implement a search functionality for quick access to patient records, appointments, and staff information.
Generate various reports, such as patient history, revenue reports, and inventory status.

File Handling:
The system will use file handling to store and retrieve data, including patient records, appointments, billing information, and more. You can use text files or structured data files to store this information securely. Ensure proper error handling and data validation to prevent data corruption or unauthorized access to files.

Technologies and Tools:

C++ for coding the application.
File handling in C++ for data storage.
Any integrated development environment (IDE) like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio for development.
